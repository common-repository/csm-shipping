The CSM Shipping Plugin connects to the CSM Shipping application via the CSM Logistics API. 
Once installed in your WooCommerce store and correctly configured, the plugin provides access to your CSM Logistics account and adds label and commercial invoice (for international shipments) generation capabilities, service and pricing lookup.

Install the plugin.
Enter your CSM account details.
Set up your required service names and pricing, map to the appropriate CSM services and manage shipments and print labels directly from the admin interface.
Consignments and parcels created using the plugin are automatically added to your account and visible within the CSM Logistics history screen.

The plugin takes all the pain out of integrating your Woo Commerce shop with the CSM Logistics Shipping Application, requiring no programming and basic configuration.

The plugin requires you to have a CSM Logistics account - for more details on how to apply for an account please see https://www.csmlogistics.co.uk/open-an-account/.

Once you have an account, please speak to your CSM Account Manager for details on how to activate your account for use with the CSM Shipping Plugin.
